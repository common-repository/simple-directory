  <?php _e('There are two listing levels available: <strong>basic</strong> and <strong>premium</strong>.  The primary difference is that premium listings display the listing\'s social media profiles as an icon bar.  If you are using <strong>Simple Directory Pro</strong>, premium listings can also display even more information such as accepted payments methods. Premium listings also display a star icon or \'Featured\' button next to the title.  You can use this to create tiered listings on your site. ','simple-dir');?>
